# MERN Chat Application

### Day-1 (January 30, 2026): Backend Development
- **Project Setup**: Initialized Node.js backend with Express server, configured for CORS and JSON parsing.
- **Database Models**:
  - `User`: Basic user schema with name, email, password (hashed with bcrypt).
  - `Group`: Group schema with name, creator reference, and group flag.
  - `GroupMember`: Junction table for group memberships with roles (admin/member).
  - `Message`: Message schema linked to groups and senders.
- **Authentication & User Management**:
  - Signup endpoint with email/name uniqueness checks and password hashing.
  - Login endpoint with JWT token generation.
  - User search by name (case-insensitive partial match).
- **Group Management**:
  - Create group endpoint (adds creator as admin).
  - List groups for a user.
- **Database Connection**: MongoDB setup with Mongoose.
- **Dependencies**: Installed Express, Mongoose, Socket.IO, bcrypt, JWT, CORS, dotenv, etc.

### Day-2 (January 31, 2026): Frontend Development
- **Project Setup**: Initialized React app with Vite, configured for routing and development.
- **Authentication Pages**:
  - `Login`: Form to authenticate users, store JWT token, redirect to chat.
  - `Signup`: User registration form (assumed similar to login).
- **Chat Interface**:
  - Main chat page with sidebar (user info, create group button, group list).
  - Chat area with message display (placeholder), input field, and send button (UI only, socket integration pending).
  - Modals for creating groups and adding members.
- **User Search Component**: Debounced search for users by name, with results display.
- **Socket Client**: Basic Socket.IO client setup (not yet integrated into chat).
- **Styling**: CSS files for chat and user search components.
- **Dependencies**: Installed React, React Router, Axios, JWT-decode, Socket.IO-client, Vite plugins, ESLint.

### Day-3 (February 1, 2026): Group Chat & Members Implementation

🗓️ Today’s Work – Group Chat & Members (Detailed)

This section documents the group chat functionality implemented today, step by step.

👥 Group Chat Implementation
1️⃣ Group Listing & Selection

Displayed all groups of the logged-in user in a sidebar

Active group is highlighted when selected

Switching groups dynamically updates the chat space

Previous group messages are cleared when switching

2️⃣ Group Chat Space (Dedicated Component)

Chat UI moved into a separate component (ChatSpace.jsx)

Clear separation between:

Group list & layout (Chat.jsx)

Message handling & sockets (ChatSpace.jsx)

Improves maintainability and prevents socket duplication issues

💬 Real-Time Group Messaging
3️⃣ Socket.IO Room-Based Messaging

Each group uses its own Socket.IO room (groupId)

When a user selects a group:

Socket joins that group room

When the user switches groups:

Socket leaves the previous room

Messages are broadcast only to members of that group

4️⃣ Message Persistence (Database)

Every message is stored in MongoDB before being emitted

Stored fields:

groupId

senderId

senderName

message

createdAt

On group selection:

Previous messages are fetched from DB via REST API

Chat history is restored instantly

🫧 Chat UI (WhatsApp-Style)
5️⃣ Message Presentation

Messages displayed as rounded chat bubbles

Layout rules:

Sender’s messages → right side

Other users’ messages → left side

Sender name shown above each message

Message timestamp shown below each message

Clean dark-themed chat layout

⬇️ Auto Scroll Behavior
6️⃣ Smooth Auto Scroll

Chat automatically scrolls to the latest message

Implemented using useRef

No extra blank space or UI jump issues

Works consistently on:

New incoming messages

Switching groups

➕ Add Members to Group
7️⃣ User Search & Add Member Flow

Added “Add Members” button in chat header

Clicking opens a modal with user search

Admin selects a user from search results

REST API call adds the selected user to the group

Clean modal-based UX

⚙️ Socket & State Handling Improvements
8️⃣ Stability & Cleanup

Proper socket listener cleanup on:

Group change

Component unmount

Prevented:

Duplicate socket events

Message leakage between groups

Ensured messages render only for the active group

✅ Outcome of Today’s Work

Fully functional real-time group chat

Persistent message history

WhatsApp-like UI & UX

Scalable component structure

Clean socket lifecycle management

### Notes
- Backend is fully functional for auth, groups, and real-time messaging.
- Frontend has UI for chat but messaging logic (via sockets) is not yet connected.
- No message persistence or member addition logic implemented yet.
- Errors in terminal suggest potential issues (e.g., missing env vars, incomplete message controller).
